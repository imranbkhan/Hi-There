----------------------------------------

Hello Lasse,

Thank you fo joining webex meeting. During meeting I have checked confirmed that this is known issue. I would like to inform yu that internal case is already opened with Product Engineering team and we also have APAR published for the same as below:
https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/apar/IJ38989

The L2 workaround  is to update the devicecategoryid value from "6"  to "1" manually 
1 - psql -U qradar -c "select id, devicetypename, devicetypedescription from sensordevicetype where devicecategoryid = 6;"
2 - psql -U qradar -c "update sensordevicetype set devicecategoryid = 1 where id=xxxx;"   whereas xxx is the ID from above

Above work around resolved the issue.  I will mark the case for closure now however you can reopen the case within next 30 days or open a new case with the reference of current one, if find any concern in future stage.

It was certainly a pleasure to work with yourself and thank you once again for using IBM Services.

Ask customer where is the qradar 7.5.0 patch file , Use Locate 742_QRadar_QRFULL or download ISO file for desired DSM
then
mount -o loop 742_QRadar_QRFULL_2020.7.0.20201113144954.iso / media/updates 
or mount -o loop isofile / media/updates


Once the ISO\SFS file has been successfully mounted use the cd command to navigate to the directory
cd /media/updates/repo
ls -l|grep -i "F5 Networks BIG-IP ASM"
yum install rpmname
